Currently it supports the above 2 languages only, but the good news is that it can be made available in any given language (non-regional), and you just need to contact us with your preferred language.
To add to the lucidity, If one has some knowledge of the Wordpress Multilingual feat, one can himself make the plugin available in any preferred language. It is that easy.
You just need to reach out to us and we will guide you with few simple steps and you will have the plugin available in the language of your choice.
### Added

In case if the product is having multiple categories then, lowest/highest percentage among all the categories will be applied.
